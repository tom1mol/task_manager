<!--this acts as a one-stop shop that neatly provides access and visibility to our JavaScript files, our CSS, and our navigation.
The point of the template is that you don't have to repeat yourself.
That is a philosophy within framework development: DRY, don't repeat yourself.
in order to inject the child content, we create an opening and a block tag. 
the block keyword is required, but in this example, we see the word content, or the string content.
